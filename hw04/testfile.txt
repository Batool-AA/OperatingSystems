 Introduction
 In today’s fast-paced digital world, efficient file transfer protocols are essential for managing large
 datasets across networks. This assignment will give you hands-on experience in creating a multi
threaded file transfer system. You will design both a server process to handle file requests and a
 client process to request and reassemble files. The goal is to ensure the file is split, transmitted,
 and reassembled correctly across concurrent connections while maintaining data integrity.
 Rationale
 As data transfer needs increase, especially in distributed systems, it’s crucial to understand how
 concurrent file handling works. This assignment introduces multi-threaded programming
